### Why I Found The Article Interesting

This article is all about creating a great data science portfolio. As a current senior studying both data science and computer science, and in the process of looking for post graduate jobs, I found the article particularly insightful. It is definitely daunting looking for a job in the CS/DS field at this time, especially with the current job market. I found myself being a little overwhelmed, concerned with what to focus on, how I should prep for interviews, and not knowing what steps to take. The article was very comprehensive and covered all aspects of a "standout" portfolio, including different ways to create one, what topics and projects to include, and what aspects are really important. I found it helpful, and I hope it helps any other students that check it out!
